### ðŸ˜ŽI'm happy to get started with the Javascript DOM.
#### âœ”This is my first project using the DOM. I want to improve myself.

#### -------What did I learn in this project?--------
* How do I access HTML elements using Javascript?
* How do I write text in HTML by assigning Id and Classes to variables?
* How do I use the for loop?
* How can I randomly get a number in the range I want?
* How do I add functions to buttons?
